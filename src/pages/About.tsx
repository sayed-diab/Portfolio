        Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a passionate front-end developer with over 5 years of experience in building modern and responsive web applications since 2019. <br />I specialize in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I am constantly expanding my skills to include frameworks such as Next.js, SASS, and Node.js.
      </p>
      <p>I have also completed a front-end development course provided by the Egyptian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in collaboration with Udacity, which enhanced my technical skills and deepened my understanding of industry best practices.</p>
